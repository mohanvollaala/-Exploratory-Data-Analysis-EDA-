# -Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries in Python. The analysis is based on a sample sales dataset containing columns such as:
-Customer_ID
-Product_ID
-Transaction_ID
-Purchase_Frequency
-Average_Order
-And others

The goal is to perform data manipulation, extract insights, and visualize important aspects of the data to better understand customer behavior and product sales.

---What I Did
Data Loading and Exploration (pandas)
Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Checked basic info, summary statistics, and displayed sample data.
Filtered data based on conditions (e.g., customers with high purchase frequency).
Created new columns like total sales and sorted data for analysis.

Data Visualization (matplotlib)
Created histograms to understand the distribution of purchase frequencies.
Plotted bar charts for total sales per product.
Customized plots with titles, labels, and colors for clarity.

Advanced Visualization (seaborn)
Used boxplots to study the distribution of average orders by product.
Created heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical features in the dataset.
Enhanced plot aesthetics for better interpretation.
